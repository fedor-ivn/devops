# Kubernetes StatefulSet

## StatefulSet implementation

```bash
$ kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc

```

```bash
$ kubectl exec app-python-0 -- cat /app/data/visits.txt
92
$ kubectl exec app-python-1 -- cat /app/data/visits.txt
35
```

The two pods, `app-python-0` and `app-python-1`, do not get the same number of
visits because of Kubernetes' load balancing feature, which spreads incoming
network traffic across multiple instances, but it do not always split the
traffic evenly. This depends on the specific load balancing algorithm used. In
this case, `app-python-0` got more requests than `app-python-1`. This is
probably because the `minikube service` sent most requests to the first pod,
while the second pod was mostly used for healthcheck requests. If a different
load balancing algorithm was used, the requests might have been split more
evenly between the two pods.

## Ordering Guarantee and Parallel Operations

For my application, ordering guarantees are unnecessary because each instance
operates independently, with no shared data between instances. Each pod has its
own filesystem, meaning that the operations of one pod do not affect the
operations of another. Given that my application does not require maintaining
order and data consistency across pods, the need for sequential start and stop
sequences offered by `StatefulSets` is unnecessary.

## Update Strategies

Kubernetes provides two update strategies for `StatefulSets`:

1. `RollingUpdate`: This is the default strategy, which incrementally replaces
Pods one-by-one. If a Pod update fails, no new updates are started. This
strategy ensures zero downtime during the update, but requires a good health
check mechanism to prevent propagation of a bad update.

1. `OnDelete`: With this strategy, the StatefulSet controller will not
automatically update the Pods. The update is triggered only when the Pods are
manually deleted by the user.
